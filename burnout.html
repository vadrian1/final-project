            <p>Everyone has experienced burnout. Whether it was work, school, or something similar, burnout can happen in any aspect of life. The official definition of burnout is: <em>to cause to fail, wear out, or become exhausted especially from overwork or overuse</em>. And it's not something that is isolated to one aspect of your life; burnout in school for example can cause you to be exhausted in your social life, and negatively impact your life overall.</p> <br>
            <p>Of course I have expereienced burnout with school like many others, but where I find burnout incredibly frusturating is creative burnout. I started to produce music as a hobby in sophomore year of highschool. Using a pirated version of FL Studio, I had fun creating silly beats and tracks and actually created things I thought that didn't sound half bad. As I created more, I found the process ever more freeing and relaxing as a creative outlet. As someone who used to be a visual artist but has created less over the years, it was amazing. </p> <br>
            <p>As time went on, I found myself improving. I began to want to take this hobby of mine more seriously. I wanted to create things that were better and start sharing my music. But as I transitioned into taking music more seriously, I found that it wasn't as fun as it used to be. The things that I created, I became less happy with. I became overcritical over my work, which led to me being more frusturated, which led to me wanting to create less. Eventually I thought everything I made was bad, so I stopped.</p>
